# XP Hero Builder — Project Reference

This file exists so a future session (this one after context compaction, or a
fresh one) can reconstruct full context from disk instead of the user
re-explaining or re-spending tokens. Written 2026-09-04. Update it as the
project evolves — don't let it go stale.

## What this project is

A fan-made, unofficial companion web app for the mobile game **XP Hero:
Weapon RPG** (`io.supercent.weaponrpg`, publisher Supercent; internal
codename **DevilHunterIdle**). User (GitHub `yo-repo87`, personal email
`mgibson041387@gmail.com`) plays the real game and wants a browser tool that
mirrors their actual in-game account state (heroes, weapons, traits,
upgrades) so they can plan builds and get advice.

- **Live site:** https://yo-repo87.github.io/xp-hero-builder/
- **Repo:** https://github.com/yo-repo87/xp-hero-builder (**public** — see
  Risk Accepted below)
- **Local path:** `/home/pi/Claude/HeroBuilder`
- Static HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS, no build step, no backend. State lives in
  `localStorage` + JSON import/export.

## Risk accepted — read before touching anything art-related

This repo embeds **real sprites ripped from the game's APK** (weapon/hero
icons, item icons, enemy portraits, chest icons — see `assets/img/`). This
was flagged to the user as a real copyright/DMCA risk **twice**, explicitly,
via `AskUserQuestion`, and both times the user chose to proceed anyway and
publish the repo **publicly** (not private). This is a known, accepted,
already-made decision — do not re-litigate it or "fix" it by stripping art
unless the user asks. If the user ever asks to reduce exposure, the honest
options are: make the repo private, or swap ripped art for original
placeholder art (was offered originally, declined).

## How the source data was obtained (methodology, for future extraction work)

The user provided a signed download URL for the APK once, at the start of
this project. It was downloaded, unpacked (`.apks` → `base.apk` +
`split_config.arm64_v8a.apk`), and mined via:

1. **IL2CPP metadata + decompilation** — `Il2CppDumper` against
   `lib/arm64-v8a/libil2cpp.so` + `global-metadata.dat` gave full C#
   class/method/field **signatures** (not bodies) for the whole game
   (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`, namespace root `DevilHunterIdle.*`,
   shared framework `Supercent.*`). For actual method **bodies** (real
   formulas), this machine turned out to be a **shared host near its RAM
   limit** (other live services: Plex, Emby, Docker, n8n) — running Ghidra's
   headless analyzer was judged too risky (OOM risk to services not owned by
   this session), so targeted functions were hand-disassembled with
   `capstone` instead (near-zero memory), using `dump.cs`'s RVA/Offset
   annotations + a sorted map of all 211,059 method addresses from
   `script.json` to resolve call targets to real names. **If Ghidra is
   available/safe in a future environment, prefer it** — capstone-by-hand
   is slower per function. Full writeup + raw disassembly:
   `docs/game_logic_deep_dive.md`, `docs/decompiled/*.asm.txt` (committed).

2. **Unity asset extraction** — `UnityPy` against the ~8,300 serialized
   files under `assets/bin/Data/` in the APK. This is how every `data/*.json`
   table and every image in `assets/img/` was obtained — table schemas were
   read directly from each TextAsset's own embedded schema row (never
   assumed), localized strings resolved against the game's own `Locale`
   table (3,543 rows, 11 languages), and sprites exported via `Sprite.image`
   (correctly atlas-cropped).

3. **Android/dex layer** — `androguard` against the dex files. Confirmed the
   whole Java/Kotlin layer is 100% third-party SDK glue (ad mediation,
   analytics, billing) with **zero custom game code** — the entire game is
   Unity/IL2CPP. Not really relevant to this app's ongoing work, but
   explains why nothing here looks at the dex layer.

**⚠️ Ephemeral scratch data**: all raw extraction artifacts (the full
`dump.cs`, `stringliteral.json`, `script.json`, the raw ~8,300-file Unity
asset tree, `catalog.json`, and the original 3 deep-dive analysis reports)
live under a **session-specific scratchpad**, not in this repo:
```
/tmp/claude-1000/-home-pi-Claude-HeroBuilder/02f52606-3961-4ca8-b582-5f08d0f66961/scratchpad/
  unpack/                 the unpacked APK (base.apk, split apk)
  il2cpp_work/            Il2CppDumper output + capstone disassembly work
    output/dump.cs          1M-line full signature dump (grep this for RVAs)
    output/stringliteral.json   ~122K string literals from the compiled game
    output/script.json      method address -> name map (211,059 entries)

    data/                  the raw ~8,300-file Unity SerializedFile tree
                            (re-scan target for pulling more art/data later)
    catalog.json            object census from the original full scan
  reports/                the 3 original deep-dive reports (Android/SDK,
                           IL2CPP, Unity assets) — broader than what ended
                           up in this app; useful background reading
```
**This directory will not exist in a future session.** If it's gone and more
extraction is needed, the APK itself is also gone (signed URL, long expired)
— you'd need the user to provide a fresh download link and redo extraction.
Treat everything already converted into `data/*.json` and `assets/img/` in
this repo as the durable record; don't assume you can re-derive more without
a fresh APK.

## Architecture

```
index.html
css/style.css              one dark-fantasy design system, rarity-color-driven
js/
  data.js                  loads data/*.json, builds all lookup indices (Game.index.*)
  formulas.js               stat-calculation logic — every formula has an inline
                             comment stating whether it's CONFIRMED (by decompilation),
                             a reasoned 'mapped' best-effort, or a flagged approximation
  state.js                  user's build (State.data), localStorage, import/export
  ui-common.js               modal/toast helpers, rarity color/tag helpers
  ui-weapons.js               Weapons tab: 6 slots + picker/upgrade modal
  ui-heroes.js                Heroes tab: roster + picker + enhance modal
  ui-equipment.js             Equipment tab: traits (2x5 slots) + 4 upgrade trees
  ui-farmable.js               Farmable Items tab: item catalog + drop sources + stage map
  ui-guide.js                  Guide tab: per-hero advice engine + Total DPS estimate
  ui-importexport.js           save-file download/upload
  app.js                     bootstrap: Game.load() -> State.init() -> renderAll()
data/*.json                 41 extracted, typed, English-labeled game-balance tables
assets/img/weapons/          84 icons, filename = WeaponData.id
assets/img/heroes/           24 icons, filename = CostumeData.id
assets/img/items/            47 icons, filename = StackableItemData.PackageIcon
assets/img/enemies/          154 portraits, filename = EnemyData.IconSprite
assets/img/chests/           3 icons, filename = ChestData.PrefabName
docs/game_logic_deep_dive.md  decompilation writeup (formulas, confidence levels)
docs/decompiled/*.asm.txt     raw annotated AArch64 disassembly
```

Rendering pattern throughout: **full re-render on every state change** (no
diffing/virtual DOM). `State.notify()` → every `*UI.render()` re-runs. This
is simple and was a deliberate choice for a small app; don't "optimize" it
without reason.

## Data provenance & confidence — read before trusting a number

Every formula in `formulas.js` is commented with its confidence level. The
short version:

| System | Status |
|---|---|
| Weapon base DPS (`base + perLevel*(level-1)`) | Real data (`BalancingData_Rarity`), but confirmed to be only the `Weapon`+`WeaponLevelBonus` **slice** of the real account-wide `Dps` stat, not the full number |
| Hero base stats (level/star/evolution) | Real data, checkpoint-interpolated where needed |
| Trait synergy token-counting | **Confirmed correct by decompilation** (`TraitSynergyController.CalculateSynergyTokens`) |
| Total DPS estimate (Guide tab) | Formula **shape confirmed** by decompiling `DpsStatCalculator`; individual source→data mappings are best-effort (each tagged `mapped`/`manual`/`unmodeled` right in the UI — see `Formulas.totalDpsBreakdown`) |
| Special Upgrade level caps | **Fixed 2026-09-04** per direct user report against the live game: uniform `grade * 10` across all stat types, NOT the per-type `SpecialUpgradeTypeData.MaxLevelDatas` table (that table's cumulative values were internally consistent but simply not what the game displays — see commit `5305f6f`) |
| Farmable Items sources | Only 4/56 catalog items (Gold, BlueStone, EXP, Wood) have a confirmed source. This is real, not a bug — only chest drop tables (`ChestData`→`RewardGroupData`) and guaranteed boss kills (`MinimapRewardData`) resolve without guessing. Shop, missions, quests, chapter-clear rewards, and boss raids were **not** explored as reward sources. |
| Combat damage formula (not used by app) | Mostly confirmed structurally; two basic-attack-only normalizer values in `CalculateDamageInternal` were left unidentified rather than guessed |

**General rule this project follows**: if a table→formula mapping can't be
confirmed or cleanly inferred, the app shows it as zero/unmodeled/manual
input with an explanation, rather than presenting a guess as fact. If you
extend this app, keep that norm — the user has corrected wrong assumptions
before (Special Upgrade caps) and values honesty over completeness.

## Git / deploy

- Local git identity is **repo-scoped** (not global): `user.name yo-repo87`,
  `user.email 317706226+yo-repo87@users.noreply.github.com`. This was set
  deliberately after the user provided a GitHub token; global git config was
  never touched (that's a hard rule regardless of context).
- `gitkey` in the repo root is a GitHub fine-grained PAT for account
  `yo-repo87`, used to create the repo and push. It's `.gitignore`d — never
  commit it. To push: `export GH_TOKEN=$(cat gitkey)` then normal git/gh
  commands.
- Deploys via GitHub Pages (branch `main`, root). **After every push, Pages
  takes ~1-2 minutes to rebuild** — a 404 right after pushing is normal, not
  a bug; it resolves itself.

## Chronological summary of work done

1. Downloaded + unpacked the APK; deep-dive analysis across 3 parallel forks
   (Android/SDK layer, IL2CPP signatures, Unity asset content) → published as
   an Artifact teardown report (not part of this repo).
2. User asked for a character-builder web app. Clarified two things upfront
   via `AskUserQuestion`: real ripped art vs. placeholder art (chose real,
   accepted risk), and repo push flow (chose build-locally-then-push).
3. Built the full app: Weapons tab (6 slots, picker/upgrade modal), Heroes
   tab (roster, picker, enhance modal), Equipment tab (traits + 4 upgrade
   trees), Guide tab (per-hero advice engine), import/export. All data/art
   extracted fresh via a dedicated fork, verified end-to-end with a headless
   Playwright pass at every stage (this is the standing QA method for this
   project — screenshot + zero-console-errors check before calling anything
   done).
4. User asked to "deep dive into the game logic" — triggered the
   Ghidra→capstone decompilation pass described above, confirming/correcting
   several formulas and updating the app's caveats to match.
5. User asked to wire the confirmed whole-account `Dps` formula into the app
   for real (not just better caveats) — added the Total DPS estimate panel
   to the Guide tab, with full per-source transparency.
6. Set up GitHub: token discovered (`gitkey`), confirmed target
   account/repo/visibility explicitly via `AskUserQuestion` (user chose
   public), created+pushed the repo, enabled Pages.
7. Added the Farmable Items tab: item catalog + drop-rate/location lookup +
   a stage-progression "map" popup (no real map-coordinate data exists in
   the game's assets, so this honestly uses the real chapter/stage list with
   the item's own icon pinned on the actual source stage(s), not a
   fabricated terrain map).
8. User reported the Special Upgrade grade-2 cap was wrong (20, not 15).
   Root-caused via full empirical re-derivation of `SpecialUpgradeLevelData`
   (found `MaxLevelDatas` was the wrong table entirely — real cap is uniform
   `grade*10`), fixed, verified, shipped.

## Open items / plausible next steps (not started)

- Expand Farmable Items coverage beyond the 4 currently-confirmed items —
  would need to explore shop/mission/quest/chapter-reward/boss-raid systems'
  `RewardGroupData` associations (the reward-group resolution mechanism
  itself is understood and working; it's the *other* systems' group IDs
  that haven't been mapped).
- `BlessingBuffData` was extracted (`data/BlessingBuffData.json`) but never
  wired into anything — 3 buff types, unclear which (if any) maps to a stat
  the app tracks.
- `VipSubscription` source in the Total DPS formula has no matching data
  table at all — stays a manual input unless one is found.
- `CostumeOwnGradeOption`/`CostumeOwnLevelOption` in the Total DPS formula
  are deliberately zeroed (no data source distinct from the `Equipping`-
  prefixed ones already used) — revisit if a relevant table turns up.
- If re-extracting art/data ever becomes necessary and the scratchpad is
  gone, you need a fresh APK download link from the user first.
